A binary search tree relies on the property that keys that are less than the parent are found in the left subtree, and keys that are greater than the parent are found in the right subtree. We will call this the bst property. 

Parse tree - What we are doing is evaluating the left subtree, evaluating the right subtree, and combining them in the root through the function call to an operator.
